# GunGameProgressionMaker
A GUI Application for creating progressions for Kodeman's GunGame. To begin you will need to update `GunData.json` to define where you want to save progressions and place the file alongside the `GunGameProgressionMaker.exe`. If you do not have Visual Studio or some other means to compile download JustNecessary.zip or JustNecessaryDark.zip this will contain the exe and 'GameData.json' 

Typical save location, note the double slash:
C:\\\Users\\\XXXX\\\AppData\\\Roaming\\\Thunderstore Mod Manager\\\DataFolder\\\H3VR\\profiles\\\XXXX\\\BepInEx\\\plugins\\\Kodeman-GunGame
